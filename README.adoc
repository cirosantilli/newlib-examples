Run one command, get bare metal arm UART minimal examples that run on QEMU, written in C using the C standard library via Newlib, with a clean toolchain built with Crosstool-NG. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

== Getting started

....
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/newlib-examples
cd newlib-examples
git submodule update --recursive
./build-ctng && ./build-qemu && ./build-samples && ./run
....

Outcome: QEMU starts, go to the terminal and type the keys:

* `'a'`
* `'b'`

and watch QEMU reply as you type with:

....
97: a
new alloc of 1 bytes at address 0x1A2E0
Heap end = 0x1B000
98: b
new alloc of 2 bytes at address 0x1A2E0
Heap end = 0x1B000
....

This example illustrates the following syscall implementations:

* `read` to get user UART input
* `write` to give UARToutput
* `sbrk` for `malloc`

== Ubuntu distro toolchain

If you are really lazy, and don't want to wait 10 minutes for the toolchain or QEMU to build, you can also do just:

....
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi qemu-system-arm
./build-samples -p arm-none-eabi-
./run -h
....

Shame on you.

== Why this is cool

Usually, when you have to explain something, it is already not cool, but here goes in any case.

This allows you to run C programs without an operating system, directly on bare metal, and use a subset of the C standard library.

This allows you to run possibly unmodified C programs directly on bare metal.

Furthermore, we build a completely pristine GCC from source via crosstool-ng, therefore dispensing any distro provided blobs.
